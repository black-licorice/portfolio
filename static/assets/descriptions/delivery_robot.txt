During my bachelor's program in engineering, I led a project to design and build an autonomous robot capable of identifying and relocating misplaced packages. This involved creating simulations, designing robot parts with CAD software, and integrating sensors and control systems. As part of my role as project manager, I familiarized myself with project management tools like status reports and Gantt charts. This experience enhanced my skills in planning, team collaboration, sensor integration, and control algorithms.
