During my bachelor's program in engineering, I participated in a project to design and build an autonomous robot capable of identifying and relocating misplaced packages to their correct destinations on a marked terrain. The project involved creating simulations, designing robot parts using CAD software, and integrating sensors and control systems for autonomous navigation. Through this project, I acquired skills in project management, including planning, decision-making, and team collaboration, as well as technical skills in autonomous systems, such as sensor integration, control algorithms, and prototyping.
