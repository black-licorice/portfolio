## Project Highlights

### Autonomous Delivery Robot

An autonomous robot designed to navigate a map, pick up packages from houses, and deliver them to the correct locations. The robot uses:
- Arduino Nano Every for control
- DC motors and servomotors
- Infrared sensors for line following
- PID control system for navigation

### Cochlear Implant Project

A project focused on designing a wireless power transfer method and signal transmission system for a cochlear implant, with emphasis on:
- Signal demodulation
- Power transfer efficiency
- Minimal signal decay
